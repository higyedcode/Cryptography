Common encoding schemes:
- ASCII encoding scheme (storing them as integers equivalent to ASCII characters)


- ASCII hex encoding(storing them as a big string of hexadecimals)


- Base64 : one character == 6 bits, 4 characters == 3 bytes;
commonly used online, for images to be included into HTML or CSS.
#Python: 
--import base64
--base64.b64encode()
