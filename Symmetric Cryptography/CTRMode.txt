e1 ^ b1 = c1 => e1 = c1^b1
e2 ^ b2 = c2 => e2 = c2^b2

16 byte block = 


OBSERVATION! IV is the same, cause step-up id False

e1 == e2 == ... == en == e

e^b1 = c1
e^b2 = c2
e^b3 = c3

Because it is a png file, we know b1 ==> e = c1^b1

This is an instruction for Linux to view contents of a png file in hex format:
    hexdump -C aes.png
